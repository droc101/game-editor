**This application only supports Linux!**

Though it may be possible to run this natively on windows, we do development on Linux, so it isn't worth the vast effort required for that.

If you are using Windows and need to run this, you may look into [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
